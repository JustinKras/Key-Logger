# Key-Logger
A simple, silent, and easy-to-use key logger for Windows.

# Instructions
- Download and run `k_l_.exe`
- A `_Data_.txt` file will be created in the same file directory where `k_l_.exe` was run. This is where all logged key-strokes will be stored.
- To terminate the process, run  `terminate.exe` and the logging process will end.
